# Levels 10-15

## Level 10 -> 11
### Instructions
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data
- `base64 -d data.txt`

## Level 11 -> 12
### Instructions
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions
- `cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`

## Level 12 -> 13
### Instructions
- The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)
- Created directory under /tmp with `mktemp -d`
- Copied data.txt into directory with `cp ~/data.txt .`
- Used mv to rename files to correct extension (.gz, .bz2, .tar)
- Check file type using `file [FILENAME]` after each unzip/extract
- `gunzip [FILENAME]`
- `bunzip2 [FILENAME]`
- `tar -xf [FILENAME]`
- `cat [FILENAME]` when data type is ASCII text

### Alternative Solution with bash script generated by claude
**[scriptlvl12.sh](scriptlvl12.sh)**
- `nano script.sh` then copy/paste
- `chmod +x script.sh` to make it executable
- `./script.sh` to run

## Level 13 -> 14
### Instructions
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on
- `scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private`
- `chmod 600 ~/keys/sshkeylvl14.private`
- `ssh -i ~/keys/sshkeylvl14.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`

## Level 14 -> 15
### Instructions
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

- `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`
- `nc localhost 30000`
- Entered previous levels password
