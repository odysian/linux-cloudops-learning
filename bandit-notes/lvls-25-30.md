# Levels 25-30
## Level 25 -> 26
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

```sh
# check shell that bandit26 uses in the passwd file
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bandit26
bandit26:x:11026:11026:bandit level 26:/home/bandit26:/usr/bin/showtex

# check script and see its running more on text.txt
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat /usr/bin/showtext
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```

```sh
# find and copy ssh key to my machine then chmod it
bandit25@bandit:~$ ls
bandit26.sshkey
bandit25@bandit:~$ cat bandit26.sshkey

$ chmod 700 bandit26.sshkey
```
```sh
# when using key to login the response is very short and immediately disconnects

# i got lost here for a while on how this works but found that you can make the terminal window smaller to make `more` switch to an interactive mode

# pressing v allows you to enter vim and enter commands to switch the shell
:set shell=/bin/bash
:shell

# this opened the bandit26 shell
bandit26@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
```

## Level 26 -> 27
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

```sh
# using the shell and the bandit27-do (like we saw in earlier level) to read the password
bandit26@bandit:~$ ls
bandit27-do  text.txt
bandit26@bandit:~$ ./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27
